# BubbleShooter
Bubble Shooter is a clone of the Puzzle Bobble arcade game.
The goal of the game is to clear the playing field by forming groups of three or more marbles of the same color. The game ends when the balls reach the bottom line of the screen. The more balls destroyed in one shot, the more points scored. A player wins when there are no balls remaining on the playing field.
Also each level has a goal related with additional items. 

It's working prototype written by me in 2020. 
The project has been closed and still contains some bugs and issues in the architecture.
